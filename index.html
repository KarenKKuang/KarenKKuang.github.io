            <h2>Enjoy the Fall Apple Harvest Season Safely</h2>

            <p><em>Out of pandemic concern, you will enjoy a different Apple Festive this year. The events will feature on their distant and de-densified versions.</em> We will hold open Air Apple Farmers Market and distant cider trail. Shops and restaurants who have safely reopened may feature apple & cider themed menus and gifts for sale too.</p>

            <p><em>Next Fall, we hope we can return to the Annual Apple Harvest Festival during the last weekend in September 2021, but for now we encourage you all to enjoy apples and apples products safely, responsibly, and socially distant.</em></p>
