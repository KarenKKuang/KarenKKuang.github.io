            <h2>Be Safe & Socially Distant & Responsible</h2>
            <p>Downtown encourages all customers and farmers to take responsibility for their own health and the health of others by adopting the following actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>New York state requires everyone to wear a face covering when in public and unable to maintain physical distancing measures.</li>

                <li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>

                <li>Lines with 6' or more of social distance between customers will be in place at the farm stands.</li>

                <li>Hand sanitizer is stationed around the Ithaca Commons, and patrons are encouraged to bring their own for personal use as well.</li>
            </ol>
